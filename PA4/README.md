# How to Run the Program
1. Type make or make prog4 to build the program.
2. Type ./prog4 <path_to_input_file> to run the program.
3. The program outputs a quadratic equation to the terminal.
4. Type make clean to remove object files and prog4

# Note on Randomized Algorithm
Because the first part of the program randomly chooses 3 points, there is a 1 percent chance that the resulting equation accounted for an outlier. If this unlikely event happens, simply re-run the program to get a better equation.
